### **Data Engineering II - Power BI / Jupyter Notebook Challenge**

#### **Objective**
The goal of this challenge is to evaluate the candidateâ€™s ability to create a compelling and insightful data analysis using **Power BI or Jupyter Notebook**. The assessment focuses on **data visualization, storytelling, and analytical skills**, ensuring the candidate can present meaningful insights effectively.

---

### **Challenge Instructions**
1. **Dataset**  
   - You are provided with a dataset containing garbage collection service records. This dataset includes details such as customer types, service requests, locations, costs, and waste types.
   - You may clean and transform the data as needed.

2. **Choose Your Analysis Tool**  
   - You can complete this challenge in **one of two ways**:
     1. **Power BI Report** â€“ Build an interactive report with a dashboard and a pivot table.
     2. **Jupyter Notebook Analysis** â€“ Use Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) to explore and visualize the dataset.

---

### **Option 1: Power BI Report Requirements**
- **Page 1 - Dashboard (Storytelling & UI/UX)**  
  - Create a visually appealing dashboard summarizing key insights from the dataset.  
  - Ensure the report has a strong **narrative**, guiding the viewer through the most critical takeaways.  
  - Use proper visualizations (bar charts, maps, KPIs, etc.).
  - The dashboard should answer high-level business questions, such as:  
    - What are the most common service types?  
    - How does the revenue from services vary across different locations?  
    - Which customer segment generates the most revenue?

- **Page 2 - Pivot Table (Metrics & Data Analysis)**  
  - Create a pivot table that presents **at least three key metrics**, such as:  
    - Total revenue per service type  
    - Average collection time per request  
    - Number of service requests by customer type  
  - The candidate should decide on meaningful metrics that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

### **Option 2: Jupyter Notebook Analysis**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Load and clean the dataset.
  - Perform a brief analysis of missing values and data distributions.
  - Generate summary statistics.

- **Data Visualization & Storytelling**  
  - Create at least **three visualizations** to explore key trends.
  - Recommended visualizations:
    - A **bar chart** showing total revenue by service type.
    - A **scatter plot** or boxplot showing collection time variations.
    - A **heatmap or pivot table** to analyze service requests per city.

- **Insights & Metrics**  
  - Compute and present key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
    - Total revenue per service type
    - Average collection time per request
    - Number of service requests per customer type
  - Summarize findings in **markdown cells**.

- **Code Best Practices**  
  - Use clean, well-commented Python code.
  - Ensure readability and maintainability.
